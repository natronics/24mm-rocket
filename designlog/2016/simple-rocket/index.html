  <p>Just throwing some numbers out there.</p>

<p>Now that I’m no longer working on a big rocket with the university, I want to do something small on my own. I was going to just build a model rocket but I quickly realised that is too easy. I don’t mind that they’re small, but the materials and techniques are too simple. Don’t get me wrong, they’re a lot of fun! But I’ve been working with rockets for too many years to get much out of them any more.</p>

<p>Instead I feel like building a rocket that will be very hard to make (difficulty is a feature!) and go a little higher than the usual Estes started kit. But I still want to stay out of High Power, so use a motor with less than <strong>H</strong> impulse.</p>

<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>

<p>Fly on an ‘F’ or ‘G’ reloadable, composite motor.</p>

<p>Use interesting materials like composites.</p>

<p>Minimal design. The case shouldn’t have extraneous inner motor mounts, fin tabs, and the like. Pure motor and skin. That means minimum diameter.</p>

<p>Flight Computer in the nosecone. Hopefully something home-made. This will certainly take longer than building the hardware. Maybe start with</p>

<p>Open Source. Publish everything here with open tools (KiCAD, FreeCAD, OpenRocket, etc.).</p>

<h2 id="early-numbers">Early Numbers</h2>

<p>Throwing just the minimum (nose, flight computer, parachute, body, fins, motor) I get a ~28 mm wide rocket with very small fins about a half meter long and weighing about 300 grams. Flying on the biggest Mid Power motor (no certs!) sims to … over 2000 meters!! That’s pretty crazy, but isn’t any more than record flights for the <strong>G</strong> motor class. By the time final weights are added I suspect that number will come down significantly.</p>

<h2 id="todo-design-problems">TODO: Design Problems</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Material availability. Where to get composites?</li>
  <li>Separation mechanism. What am I going to do for this? It’s not off the shelf.</li>
  <li>Flight computer?</li>
  <li>Sizing and making parachutes. Recovery system in general is the hardest part of the rocket.</li>
  <li>Launch tower? I’m not using rail buttons, so no rails.</li>
  <li>Where to launch?</li>
</ul>
